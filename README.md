# Webshop-Cart-project
A vanilla Javascript project. Concentrating on show-hide functionality with the cart element and also very important was to solve the data infusion with JSON and LocalStorage so if you refresh the data will not be erased.
The site structure itself is simple also with a CSS (responsive, grid).
The card content is not exsisting in HTML what is very nice, I left a fragment commented out, to make it easier to imagine what will be imported with the JSON file. 
Async - await was mandatory also a lot of {dynamic} elements. LocalStorage = Web Storage API. I used also Classes,
and innerHTML innerText manipulation. There is a counter as well with map() and parseFloat() and classList add - remove functions and a lot of other methods. I made a detailful project-process guide in the end of the .js file. 
I made this to train myself about all the things above a lot of thanks for freecodecamp.org.
